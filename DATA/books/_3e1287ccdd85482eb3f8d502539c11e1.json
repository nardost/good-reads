Told in Hamid\u0027s own words, the story reveals the hardship and suffering experienced by immigrants who are rebuilding their lives with little understanding of the language and culture in a new country. Life starts to get easier, but the horrors of the war are never far from Hamid\u0027s thoughts. The BAFTA award-winning Seeking Refuge stories were originally produced as animations for the BBC. These powerful and evocative stories have now been captured in book form as rich, visual testimonies of the torment, hope and resolution of young refugees who are seeking asylum and adjusting to life in new countries all over the world. The series of five books form an excellent cross-curricular resource that looks at asylum, war, separation and integration and what it is to be a refugee today making them ideal for tying into Refugee Week.","pages":32,"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1488477750l/34449929._SX318_.jpg"}]
