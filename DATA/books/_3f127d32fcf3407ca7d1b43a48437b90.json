Here are patterns taken from actual dresses, many of them rare museum specimens, illustrated by sketches of the dresses. There are notes on the production of women\u0027s dress, with references to early technical books and journals, together with diagrams from some of them. Numerous illustrations show the dresses as worn complete with their hairstyles, jewelry, decorations and accessories.","pages":336,"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347303470l/1472903.jpg"},{"id":"18378023","title":"The Examined Life: How We Lose and Find Ourselves","authors":[{"id":"1140718","path":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1140718.Stephen_Grosz","name":"Stephen Grosz"}],"genres":["Autobiography","Memoir","Personal Development","Health","Psychoanalysis","Psychology","Nonfiction","Science","Mental Health","Philosophy","Self Help","Audiobook"],"blurb":"Echoing Socrates\u0027 time-honoured statement that the unexamined life is not worth living, psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz draws short, vivid stories from his 25-five-year practice in order to track the collaborative journey of therapist and patient as they uncover the hidden feelings behind ordinary behaviour. These beautifully rendered tales illuminate the fundamental pathways of life from birth to death. A woman finds herself daydreaming as she returns home from a business trip; a young man loses his wallet. We learn, too, from more extreme examples: the patient who points an unloaded gun at a police officer, the compulsive liar who convinces his wife he\u0027s dying of cancer. The stories invite compassionate understanding, suggesting answers to the questions that compel and disturb us most about love and loss, parents and children, work and change. The resulting journey will spark new ideas about who we are and why we do what we do.","pages":240,"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400887195l/18378023.jpg"},{"id":"22816793","title":"Funny Jokes (FREE Joke Book Download Included!): 125+ Hilarious Jokes (Funny and Hilarious Joke Book for Children)","authors":[{"id":"7430345","path":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7430345.Johnny_B_Laughing","name":"Johnny B.
