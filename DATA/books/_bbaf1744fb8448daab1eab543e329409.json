Set in Moscow during a three-day period in December 1949, \u0027The First Circle\u0027 is the story of the prisoner Gleb Nerzhin, a brilliant mathematician. At the age of thirty-one, Nerzhin has survived the war years on the German front and the postwar years in a succession of Russian prisons and labor camps. His story is interwoven with the stories of a dozen fellow prisoners - each an unforgettable human being - from the prison janitor to the tormented Marxist intellectual who designed the Dnieper dam; of the reigning elite and their conflicted subordinates; and of the women, wretched or privileged, bound to these men. A landmark of Soviet literature, \u0027The First Circle\u0027 is as powerful today as it was when it was first published, nearly thirty years ago.","pages":580,"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1171430589l/98969.jpg"},{"id":"478775","title":"Bas Rutten\u0027s Big Book of Combat Volume 1","authors":[{"id":"195424","path":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/195424.Stephen_Quadros","name":"Stephen Quadros"},{"id":"195425","path":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/195425.Bas_Rutten","name":"Bas Rutten"}],"genres":["Martial Arts","Combat","Nonfiction"],"blurb":"","pages":550,"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387747918l/478775.jpg"}]
